Model
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Model denote a set of features.
It has naming convension: ``([A-Z][a-z0-9]*)+``.

This basic model is the whole set of features.
If we add a device with basic model, we will be asked to select which
features is desired.

If we want to make an alias of a set of features,
we can create a custom model.
